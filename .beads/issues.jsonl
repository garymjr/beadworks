{"id":"server-avc","title":"Rewrite useAgentEvents tests","description":"\nThe useAgentEvents tests were fundamentally broken and making real server calls. They have been temporarily skipped.\n\n**Testing requirements for useAgentEvents:**\n- Connection establishment to SSE endpoint\n- Event processing (status, progress, step, error, complete)  \n- Reconnection with exponential backoff\n- Server-first architecture (fetch status on mount/reconnect)\n- No localStorage usage for persistence\n- State transitions and error handling\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- packages/ui/src/hooks/__tests__/useAgentEvents.test.ts\n\n**Note:** The hook implementation is correct and works in the application. Tests need proper mocking of EventSource and fetchWorkStatus.\n\nDiscovered-from: server-aro.6\n","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-24T21:54:47.302411-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T21:54:47.302411-07:00"}
