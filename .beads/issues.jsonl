Implement createProject, getProject, listProjects, updateProject, and deleteProject methods. Use Node.js fs.promises for async file operations. Create a .data/projects directory if it doesn't exist. Add proper error handling for ENOENT, EACCES, and JSON parse errors.\n2. **Create REST API endpoints for project CRUD** - Add routes in packages/server/src/routes/projects.ts for GET /api/projects (list), GET /api/projects/:id (read), POST /api/projects (create), PUT /api/projects/:id (update), DELETE /api/projects/:id (delete). Integrate with storage.service.ts. Add request validation using zod or similar. Return proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 400, 500). Register routes in the main server file.\n3. **Create API client service on frontend** - Create packages/ui/src/lib/api/projects.ts with functions matching the backend endpoints (getProjects, getProject, createProject, updateProject, deleteProject). Use fetch or axios for HTTP requests. Implement proper error handling with try/catch and typed return values. Add loading state management if needed.\n4. **Update frontend to use API instead of localStorage** - Find all localStorage usage in packages/ui (grep for 'localStorage'). Replace direct localStorage calls with the new API client functions. Update any React hooks or components that read/write project data. Ensure loading states are handled during async operations. Test the UI to verify projects load and save correctly.\n5. **Implement localStorage to JSON file migration** - Create packages/ui/src/lib/migration.ts with a migrateFromLocalStorage() function. Check for existing projects in localStorage on app init. If found, send to backend via createProject API calls, then clear localStorage. Add a migration flag to localStorage to prevent re-migration. Show a loading indicator during migration.\n6. **Add backend tests for storage service and API** - Create packages/server/src/services/storage.service.test.ts. Test file creation, reading, writing, updating, deleting, and error cases (corrupted JSON, missing files). Create packages/server/src/routes/projects.test.ts. Test each endpoint with valid/invalid data. Use jest with fs mock or temp directory for file system tests.\n\n**Risks \u0026 Considerations:**\n- Concurrent write conflicts if multiple browser tabs modify the same project\n- Data loss if migration fails partway through - need transaction-like behavior\n- File system permissions issues on different operating systems\n- Large project files causing performance issues\n- Backward compatibility if users have existing localStorage data and server is unavailable\n","created_at":"2025-12-24T16:24:33Z"},{"id":2,"issue_id":"server-d98","author":"garymjr","text":"✅ Completed by agent:\n\nLet me start implementing:","created_at":"2025-12-24T16:24:33Z"},{"id":3,"issue_id":"server-d98","author":"garymjr","text":"✅ Completed by agent:\n\nI'll help you implement JSON file system storage for projects.

The backend will expose API endpoints for CRUD operations on projects stored in a projects.json file, and the UI will be updated to fetch from these endpoints instead of reading from localStorage. A one-time migration script will transfer existing localStorage data to the new file-based storage.\n\n**Subtasks:**\n1. **Create JSON file storage service in backend** - Create packages/server/src/services/projectStorage.ts with a ProjectStorage class that handles reading/writing to a data/projects.json file. Implement methods: readProjects(), writeProjects(projects), and ensureProjectDirectory(). Include error handling for file system operations, file locking for concurrent writes, and data validation using Zod schemas matching the existing Project type.\n2. **Add project API endpoints to backend server** - Create packages/server/src/routes/projects.ts with REST endpoints: GET /api/projects (list all), GET /api/projects/:id (get one), POST /api/projects (create), PUT /api/projects/:id (update), DELETE /api/projects/:id (delete). Integrate with ProjectStorage service. Add request validation using Zod and return appropriate status codes (200, 201, 404, 400). Register routes in packages/server/src/index.ts.\n3. **Create localStorage to JSON file migration script** - Create packages/server/scripts/migrateFromLocalStorage.ts. Script should: 1) Read localStorage data export (JSON file), 2) Validate against Project schema, 3) Merge with existing projects.json (if any), 4) Write to data/projects.json via ProjectStorage. Add npm script 'bun migrate:projects' to run it. Include dry-run mode and backup creation before writing.\n4. **Update UI to use API instead of localStorage** - Refactor packages/ui/src/routes/index.tsx to replace localStorage.getItem/setItem calls with API fetch requests. Create packages/ui/src/api/projects.ts with functions: getProjects(), getProject(id), createProject(data), updateProject(id, data), deleteProject(id). Update all components using project data to use these API functions. Handle loading/error states appropriately.\n5. **Add unit tests for project storage service** - Create packages/server/src/services/projectStorage.test.ts. Test cases: file creation, reading empty storage, writing projects, updating existing projects, deleting projects, concurrent write handling, invalid data handling, and error recovery. Use Jest with fs mocks and temporary test directories. Ensure 100% coverage of ProjectStorage methods.\n6. **Add integration tests for project API endpoints** - Create packages/server/src/routes/projects.test.ts. Use supertest to test all endpoints: successful CRUD operations, validation errors for malformed data, 404 for non-existent projects, and error handling for storage failures. Test with actual temporary file storage to verify end-to-end functionality.\n7. **Configure data directory and add to gitignore** - Add data/ to .gitignore to prevent committing user projects. Ensure packages/server initializes data directory on startup if it doesn't exist. Add environment variable PROJECTS_DATA_PATH (default: ./data/projects.json) for configurable storage location. Update README.md with new storage architecture documentation.\n\n**Risks \u0026 Considerations:**\n- Data corruption during concurrent writes - need proper file locking or atomic write patterns\n- Migration from localStorage may fail if data format has changed - need robust validation and rollback\n- File system permissions issues on different operating systems - need proper error handling\n- Performance degradation with large project files - consider indexing or pagination for future\n- Race conditions between UI components updating same project - may need optimistic locking or versioning\n","created_at":"2025-12-24T16:31:04Z"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-24T11:20:17.939229-07:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}
